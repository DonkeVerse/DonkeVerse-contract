1. Gas will be measured by hardhat 2.6.8
2. You must use Solidity 8.10
3. You may use whatever optimizations on the Solidity compiler you like as long as it is known to be secure
4. You must use this account for signing (second in Hardhat)
Account #1: 0x70997970c51812dc3a010c7d01b50e0d17dc79c8
Private Key: 0x59c6995e998f97a5a0044966f0945389dc9e86dae88c7a8412f4603b6b78690d
5. Assembly is allowed if you can demonstrate it is secure
6. Using loops to fulfill ERC721 functionality are not accepted
7. Wallets cannot hold more than two pieces
8. Total supply is 7777
9. Price is 0.06 ether
10. Alternatives to public signature whitelisting will be considered, but it must be secure
11. There must be no security bugs
12. There are two known improvements we have not shared. If you discover them first, you get a whitelist for each of the two. If nobody can improve on our gas cost, you will be upgraded to a free mint.
13. To be considered for a free mint, you must present a solution that is better than 80,767 gas OR be the first to find one of the two hidden solutions AND no-one else finds an improvement.
14. Cryptographic solutions must follow best practices. Recovering signatures from ECDSA must be from hashes. Signed messages must be salted according to EIP191.
15. We reserve the right to make the final decision about what solutions are accepted. We reserve the right to reward innovative solutions at our discretion.
16. Solutions must be submitted before January 18 Midnight UTC to allow time to be incorporated into the audit.
17. We will pay the gas for people who recieve a free mint.
